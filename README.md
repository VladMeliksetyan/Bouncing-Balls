# Bouncing Balls Animation

This project creates an animation of balls that bounce within the boundaries of a container. The balls lose velocity upon each bounce and eventually stop when their velocity is sufficiently low. Clicking within the container spawns new balls at the click location.

## Features

- Click to spawn new balls.
- Balls move in a random direction.
- Gravity affects the vertical motion of the balls.
- Balls bounce off the boundaries of the container.
- Balls lose velocity upon each bounce and stop when their velocity is sufficiently low.
